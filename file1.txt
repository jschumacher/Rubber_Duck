So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

This is a Beatles Song.

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

This is a Beatles Song.
